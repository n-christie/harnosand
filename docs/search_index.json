The development of age-friendly communities to promote active and healthy ageing is strongly supported, but knowledge of whether such initiatives are effective in terms of economic and quality-of- life impacts is lacking. 2.2 Project Objectives The project aims to develop a model for long-term evaluation of municipal initiatives towards active and healthy ageing, with a focus on care and cooperation between different sectors and actors. 2.2.1 Specific research questions What are the effects of a municipal Intervention Package concerning health, well-being, active ageing and utilization of health care and social services? How are the effects distributed in the population, considering, for example, socioeconomic, gender, and ethnicity dimensions? What resources are required and what are the costs of the Intervention Package? How do the effects of the Intervention Package impact resource distribution and costs related to the ageing population, and how are these costs distributed across municipality, region and government levels? How are the outcomes of the Intervention Package related to attitudes to age and ageing (i.e., ageism), future outlook, intervention confidence, and readiness for change of older adults, their family members/informal carers, and staff? What seems to be working and what does not, and how could the broad municipal initiative be redesigned and optimized? 2.3 Budget and annual reports https://harnosand.se/kommun--styrning/ekonomi-och-upphandling/ekonomi-och-styrning.html Public heatlh https://harnosand.se/kommun--styrning/folkhalsa/folkhalsoarbete.html "],["the-härnösand-initiative.html", "3 The Härnösand Initiative 3.1 Outcome definitions 3.2 Utfallsfonden 3.3 Development projects in Härnösand", " 3 The Härnösand Initiative https://www.mannheimerswartling.se/en/assignment/the-municipality-of-harnosand-enters-into-a-social-outcomes-contract-with-utfallsfonden/ https://harnosand.se/om-webbplatsen/sok.html?query=Utfallsfonden 3.1 Outcome definitions From Handlingar kommunstyrelsen 2024/02/13: https://harnosand.se/download/18.7c3b4d7718d6fe74b4fa6eac/1707215813865/Handlingar%20kommunstyrelsen%202024-02-13.pdf From Handlingar kommunstyrelsen 2024/02/13: Invånare 65+ i särskilt boende eller med hemtjänst i ordinärt boende, andel (%) ”Andelsmått” betyder det index i Kolada som benämns ”Invånare 65+ med hemtjänst i ordinärt boende, andel (%)”. ”SÄBO-mått” betyder det index som i Kolada benämns ”Invånare 65+ i särskilda boendeformer, andel (%)”. ”Kvalitetsmått” betyder det index som i Kolada benämns ”Brukarbedömning hemtjänst äldreomsorg - helhetssyn, andel (%)”. ”Timmått” betyder det index i Kolada benämnt ”Beviljade antal hemtjänsttimmar per brukare och månad för timregistrerade hemtjänsttagare 65+ i ordinärt boende, timmar/hemtjänsttagare”. 3.2 Utfallsfonden https://www.utfallsfonden.se/ 3.3 Development projects in Härnösand https://mittharnosand.se/harnosand-vaxer/utvecklingsprojekt 3.3.1 New retiremnt home https://mittharnosand.se/harnosand-vaxer/utvecklingsprojekt/skola-och-omsorg/nytt-aldreboende "],["comparable-municipalities.html", "4 Comparable municipalities 4.1 From VR Proposal 4.2 Matching - from data found in Register-RELOC-AGE 4.3 Matching - other ideas", " 4 Comparable municipalities 4.1 From VR Proposal Per the grant proposal, three comparable municipalities will be identified and used as controls. “Härnösand is the intervention municipality, with three other municipalities as controls. Based on information from the Kolada database (Jul 30, 2024), Avesta, Ludvika, Ronneby and Karlskoga are most like Härnösand when it comes to health care and social services for older adults. Two of those and one municipality of similar size as Härnösand will be selected among the nine municipalities in Sweden affiliated with the AFCC network.” Referring to the WHO website for Age friendly cities and communities and the website Myndigheten för delaktighet, the following 9 municipalities are members of the AFCC network: Gävle, Göteborg, Hallstahammar, Stockholm, Uppsala, Kristianstad, Botkyrka, Upplands-Bro, Östersund Avesta, Ludvika, Ronneby and Karlskoga https://extranet.who.int/agefriendlyworld/search-network/?_sft_countries=sweden https://www.mfd.se/samhallsomraden/utformning-av-fysisk-miljo/aldersvanliga-stader-och-samhallen/ 4.2 Matching - from data found in Register-RELOC-AGE Kolada’s data is extensive and I would argue is a superior source to identify comparable municipalities. However, there are some metrics which could be useful, depending on the metrics desired. I have created a tool to identify comparable municipalities based on a few hand-chosen metrics. Other metrics can be added - let me know and I can add them to the tool. It can be found below (may be slow to load), or accessed directly at https://nickchristie.shinyapps.io/harnosand/ : 4.3 Matching - other ideas The Härnösand Initiative specifies Kolada metrics in which the success (and funding) is dependent on. The text below is from a Kommunstyrelsen meeting which defines the metrics. The meeting notes may be found here: https://harnosand.se/download/18.7c3b4d7718d6fe74b4fa6eac/1707215813865/Handlingar%20kommunstyrelsen%202024-02-13.pdf Invånare 65+ i särskilt boende eller med hemtjänst i ordinärt boende, andel (%) ”Andelsmått” betyder det index i Kolada som benämns ”Invånare 65+ med hemtjänst i ordinärt boende, andel (%)”. ”SÄBO-mått” betyder det index som i Kolada benämns ”Invånare 65+ i särskilda boendeformer, andel (%)”. ”Kvalitetsmått” betyder det index som i Kolada benämns ”Brukarbedömning hemtjänst äldreomsorg - helhetssyn, andel (%)”. ”Timmått” betyder det index i Kolada benämnt ”Beviljade antal hemtjänsttimmar per brukare och månad för timregistrerade hemtjänsttagare 65+ i ordinärt boende, timmar/hemtjänsttagare”. I have yet to track down the exact Kolada data item for these metrics. However, since the success of the Initiative will be judged by these metrics, it can be argued that municipalities with comparable values of these metrics would be superior candidates for comparisons. Here are some similar metrics: N20891 - Antal personer 65+ år i särskilt boende eller med hemtjänst i ordinärt boende, dividerat med antal invånare 65+ år den 31/12. N21700 - Antal personer 65-79 år med hemtjänst i ordinärt boende, dividerat med antal invånare 65-79 år den 31/12. N21704 Antal personer 80+ år med hemtjänst i ordinärt boende, dividerat med antal invånare 80+ år den 31/12. U21468 -Antal personer i åldrarna 65 år och äldre som uppgett “Mycket nöjd” eller “Ganska nöjd” på frågan “Hur nöjd eller missnöjd är du sammantaget med den hemtjänst du har?” If we identify the exact metric numbers from Kolada, we can pull the data and find comparables. Or use their tool. Here are these metrics plotted for some comparable municipalities: "],["data-sources---register-data.html", "5 Data Sources - Register data 5.1 Register descriptions", " 5 Data Sources - Register data 5.1 Register descriptions Below describes Register data from the Register RELOC-AGE project.
